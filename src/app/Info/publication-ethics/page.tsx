          Reviewers evaluate manuscripts based on content without regard to ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, citizenship, religious belief or political philosophy of the authors. They should have no conflict of interest with respect to the research, the authors and/or the research funders. Their judgments should be objective.

          Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by the authors.
