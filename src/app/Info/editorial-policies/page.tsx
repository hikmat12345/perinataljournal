          Perinatal Journal is an open access journal and has no any

          Charge (APC) for only accepted articles. No fees are requested from
          the authors during submission and evaluation process. All manuscripts
          must be submitted via Manuscript Manager. When you are informed that
          your article has been accepted for preperation about publication, you
          have to make payment as soon as possible, otherwise will not be
          appearing on early view page and not published which means it is not
          accepted publication.
          <br />
          The APCs will be accepted through the link that will be sent to the
          corresponding author of each article via the online article system. In
          the next step, the authors will be receiving a receipt of their
          payment. Please be aware that no any refund is possible for your
          payment.

          All manuscripts that are submitted to the Perinatal Journal are first
          subjected to technical evaluation in terms of conformance to the
          journal’s manuscript rules and plagiarism at the preliminary
          evaluation. One of the Editors evaluates whether the manuscripts are
          within the scope of the journal or not, and when they are not within
          the scope, the Editor either rejects them directly or sends back to
          authors to make the papers comply with publication scope and rules.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the next stage of the evaluation, manuscripts that are within the
          scope of the journal undergo double-blind peer review. An Editor is
          assigned for the manuscript to conduct the peer review process. Each
          submission will be reviewed by at least two external reviewers who are
          experts in their fields relevant to the paper and invited by the
          assigned Editor. These reviewers can be also selected from the members
          of the Advisory Board. The Editorial Board will assign an external and
          independent editor to manage the evaluation processes of manuscripts
          submitted by the Editorial Board members of the journal.
          <br />
          <br />
          If any revision is required in the manuscripts according to the
          comments of the reviewers, the Editor assigned to the paper makes sure
          that the revisions from corresponding author are re-evaluated by
          reviewers. This Editor is authorized to suggest required corrections
          and changes upon the comments and suggestions of reviewers, and/or to
          correct or shorten the text by permission of the corresponding author.
          In the end, the assigned Editor submits their suggestion of acceptance
          or rejection for publishing to Editors-in-Chief. If there are any
          concerns about statistics in reviewer comments, the paper is evaluated
          by Statistics Editor. If necessary, external statistics experts can be
          asked for their opinion.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Editors-in-Chief are the final authority in the decision to
          publish the manuscript or not. They also have the right to reject a
          manuscript after authors’ revision. Author(s) should provide
          additional relevant data, documents, or information upon the editorial
          request if necessary.
